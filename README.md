# SPARKIFY-CAPSTONE
# Description
Predict customer churn with PySpark for an imaginary digital music service called Sparkify. Sparkify has a free-tier and a premium subscription plan. Users can upgrade, downgrade or cancel their service at any time. Churn means downgradding from premium to free tier or cancelling the service. If we can predict users who will churn, the company can offer them discounts and incentives to entice them to stay.
# Installation
    This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

    Python

    Spark

    Pyspark

    pandas

    Matplotlib

    Seaborn

    You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

  If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already   has the above packages and more included. And for Spark, you can do this using AWS or IBM Cloud.

# Project Motivation
This is udacity's capstone project, using spark to analyze user behavior data from music app Sparkify.

Sparkify is a music app, this dataset contains two months of sparkify user behavior log. The log contains some basic information about the user as well as information about a single action. A user can contain many entries. In the data, a part of the user is churned, through the cancellation of the account behavior can be distinguished.

# Files Description
Sprakify .ipynb Main file of the project, it demonstrates the process of using pyspark to explore the data and build the model.
# Result
According to the results of the model, it is the frequency of Thumbs Down that has the greatest impact. Churn users have more Thumbs Down. Naturally, users will leave if they are not satisfied.

I post a blog about the detail, you can find it here.
